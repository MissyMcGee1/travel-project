            <h2>Why Indonesia?</h2>
            <h3>Indonesia, the country of 17,000 islands</h3>
            <p>
              Indonesia is a breathtakingly beautiful country. With thousands of
              islands, hundreds of languages and dialects and home to the second
              largest coastline in the world, Indonesia is rich with culture,
              beaches and wildlife.
            </p>
            <p>
              From Bali to the Gili Islands to Komodo National Park, there is
              something for every type of traveller. Indonesia is known for its
              crystal clear blue water, cascading mountains and delicious food.
              The country is rooted in religion and you will find temples and
              mosques everywhere you go. The people are warm, welcoming and some
              the nicest I have ever met.

                <p>
                  Padar Island has one of the most beautiful view points I have
                  ever seen! After a short, 30 minute up hill walk from the
                  beach you reach your destination with a view of 3 secluded
                  beaches and mountains.
                </p>
                <h5>Where to stay</h5>
                <p>
                  The island is only open for day trips as there is no
                  accommodation. Be sure to organize your boat for an early
                  morning departure, ensuring you arrive before the island gets
                  busy with tourists.
                </p>
                <h5>Why you should go here</h5>
                <p>
                  The reward for such short hike can not be understated. The
                  magnificent beaches and mountains are sure to take your breath
                  away.

            <p>
              Hi, my name is Missy and my passion for travelling first brought
              me to Indonesia in 2018. After falling in love with the people,
              culture and landscapes, I decided to return in 2023 to spend the
              month of February island hopping to experience the people and
              culture once again.
